## Happiness

> "Wherever you go, there you are."

I spend a lot of time thinking about what it means to be happy. I think a lot of it has to do with being completely content with exactly who you are at this very moment, and always striving to improve. These two concepts seem contradictory, but they're not.

It's easy to justify delaying happiness based on some external or internal circumstance. If I had a better job, was in better shape, made more money, found the perfect partner, and so on, then I'd finally be happy with myself and my situation, and be able to relax and feel self-actualized.

But the journey never ends. No matter where you are or what you've done or how hard you've worked, you know it can always be better, improved. It's easy to compare yourself to others and place unrealistic expectations on yourself, because there will always be someone smarter, fitter, more attractive, more successful.

It's human nature to want to improve, because you always can, in every way. So in acknowledging there's no end to the possibilities self-improvement, you can acknowledge that there is no final happiness end point.

Imagine that you had no wants or desires. Everything you could want to be, you already are. Everything you could want to have, you already have. You've done the best you could up to this point, and now you're here. You can be the person who loves you the most, and the one that inspires you and comforts you. It's entirely possible to be emotionally self-sufficient yet still have an unlimited amount of love left over to give to another, to friends and family and strangers in need.

We can love and accept ourselves completely and still want to improve. These things are not mutually exclusive.

## Goals

> "You don't need a mentor - you can't outsource the responsibility for planning the course of your life."

Inspiration is not your friend. Motivation is not your friend. Big, vague goals are overwhelming and discouraging. Anything worth doing is hard, and when inspiration and motivation run out, the only thing you have left is discipline.

Everything I've ever achieved has been through doing something small, incremental, daily, and almost trivial. I just do something, sometimes something I really, really don't want to do, every single day, until it becomes habit.

Let go of any self-imposed limitations. You can do anything, you just can't do everything. The possibilities within you are endless.
If ever you feel jealous of something that someone else has accomplished, remember to always be jealous of everything that led to it as well. If you're jealous of their musical talent, be jealous of the hundreds of hours they put into practicing.

If you're jealous of someone else's physical fitness, be jealous of the hundreds of hours they spent working out.

If you're worried about the time it will take you to accomplish something, just remember that the time will pass anyway.
If I had one piece of advice for anyone who is trying to figure out their passion, it's this: think of something, anything that you can do for hours on end and feel like no time has passed at all.

## Mistakes

> No matter how far you've gone down the wrong road, turn back."

I've made many mistakes, and I have many regrets. I absolutely cannot say I've lived a life free of regrets. People I've hurt, time I've wasted, it has all affected me.

I bet you've made mistakes and have regrets as well. Here are some things I keep in mind when things are hardest.

Something I repeat to myself a lot is, "you need to deal with reality, not what you wish reality was."

Try not to spend a moment thinking about what could have been, what you could have done. You can never, ever change what has happened. The past is completely out of your control. You don't get to choose today who you were yesterday. You are also under no obligation to be that person you were yesterday.

You can make it better. You can change your perspective. You can let go and grow. Not everything has closure. Never forget the time you wasted and the people you've hurt, because it's from those mistakes and experiences that you cultivate empathy and understanding. When you're inevitably hurt in the future, you'll see that they're all just people, just like you.

Just don't give up. Don't let yourself succumb to self-pity. Don't ever let your problem be your identity. You're going to fuck up, and for each step backwards, try to take two steps forward.

I know I'm never going to stop trying. Sometimes it's even possible to do your best, make no mistakes and still lose. Just keep trying.

> "Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let the pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place."

There is always something beautiful. There is always good to be found. Be enthusiastic. Share your ideas with the world.
